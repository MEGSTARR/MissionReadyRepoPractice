        <h2 class="intro">QUOTE OF THE DAY IS: "Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow. It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow."</h2>
